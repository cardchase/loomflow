> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 An AI + Human Community Collaboration**
>
> Loomflow is a modern, visual data engineering platform co-created in partnership between **Advanced AI Coding Agents** and the **Human Developer Community**! Built completely from scratch, this project represents the future of agentic development. 

Welcome to the **Loomflow** open-source community! 🌍 Our mission is to build a vibrant, exciting, and beautiful platform where data engineers and analysts can effortlessly create, share, and manage a vast ecosystem of custom data processing tools. Let your imagination go wild! 🚀

Loomflow brings the drag-and-drop visual pipeline building of massive enterprise tools directly to your local machine. Visually construct your data workflows, connect nodes with wires, and execute pipelines in-memory utilizing the lightning-fast Rust-based **Polars** engine. Whether you're dealing with a tiny CSV or millions of rows from a massive SQL warehouse, Loomflow handles it with absolute elegance.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Loomflow bridges the gap between complex code-based data preparation and heavy enterprise ETL licensing.

- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag-and-drop tools to build Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of your data pipeline.
- **In-Memory Executions**: Process data locally using **Polars** yielding sub-millisecond execution times.
- 🐘 **Big Data Ready**: Connect directly to massive SQL Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) via highly-parallelized `connectorx` Arrow drivers.
- 🧠 **Smart DAG Pruning & Persistent Disk Caching**: Fully integrated node-caching capabilities. Click the Cache button to **Freeze** a node's output directly to highly compressed Parquet files on your hard drive. This survives server restarts and instantly bypasses expensive upstream computations (like ML predictions) in milliseconds!
- 🏗️ **Union & Deduplication**: Stack datasets seamlessly or isolate distinct entries.
- 📊 **Interactive Web Visuals**: Dynamically generate rich, interactive Scatter, Line, Bar, and Box plots using the integrated `Plotly` HTML backend. Hover, zoom, and pan directly inside your results grid!
- ✨ **Multimodal Generative AI**: Seamlessly process Text, Images, Video, and Audio using the integrated **Gemini AI** node! Throw files and prompts at the node and watch it dynamically extract data into a new column.
- 🐍 **Advanced Python Scripting**: A built-in Python tool featuring a beautifully integrated **native syntax-aware IDE**, complete with column-aware autocompletion (just type `df["`). Contains pre-built templates for hitting external APIs or running custom LLMs directly inside your pipeline!
- 🤖 **Agent-Ready Architecture**: Export your complex mathematical workflows into an ultra-clean, machine-readable YAML file in one click. Send this single file to any AI Agent or LLM to automate, improve, or instantly orchestrate your intelligence platform from scratch!
- 💾 **Workflow Save/Load**: Never lose your progress. Export your complete ETL pipeline architecture to JSON and restore it at any time directly from the visual canvas.
- 🤝 **Share & Collaborate**: Because workflows are saved as ultra-lightweight JSON files, you can instantly share them over Slack, Discord, or GitHub! The community can load your exact pipeline to help you debug errors, build custom visualizations, or extend your data models.
- 🛡️ **Zero Data-Loss Auto-Recover**: Loomflow features an enterprise-grade, two-tier autosave system. Workflows are instantly cached to your browser locally, while a debounced network process physically streams rolling `.autosave` increments to your backend server to protect you against catastrophic cache-wipes!
- 🗂️ **Multi-Tabbed Workspaces**: Work on multiple isolated DAGs simultaneously, just like a modern IDE! Open, swap, and execute multiple independent pipelines via a seamless tab bar without ever overwriting your progress.
- 📂 **Flexible I/O**: Ingest CSVs, Excel files, Text files, Word Documents, Database files (SQLite, Microsoft Access), parse tables directly out of PDFs, or write out fully interactive HTML visualizations.
- ☁️ **Global Cloud Integrations**: Loomflow features a unified authentication system for cloud providers. Upload a Google Cloud `Service Account JSON` or `OAuth 2.0 Client Secret` exactly once in the global toolbar to instantly and securely authenticate all downstream cloud nodes simultaneously!
- 📁 **Massive Batch Processing**: Use `Folder Input` to recursively scan directories and `Dynamic Input` to merge hundreds of heterogeneous CSV/Excel files diagonally, bypassing the need for identical schemas.
- 🛑 **Interactive Workflow Cancellation**: Stop run-away pipelines or infinitely looping nodes instantly! Hit the global Stop button, or hover over any running node's spinner to surgically abort its execution mid-loop without losing upstream data.
- **Self-Hosted & Privacy-First**: Run both the web UI and the execution engine entirely on your local machine. No external APIs required (unless explicitly using the Gemini node).

## 🎨 Enterprise UI & Semantic Intelligence

Loomflow brings the dense, hyper-productive feel of professional enterprise suites into the open-source era:

- 📊 **Alteryx-Inspired Configuration Panels**: We've replaced bulky forms with compact, spreadsheet-like tabular grids. Manage hundreds of columns in a single dense view using intuitive checkboxes, dropdowns, and text fields—all while maintaining a gorgeous glassmorphic aesthetic.
- 📦 **Tool Containers**: Seamlessly group workflows into bounded, resizable visual containers. Disable entire containers with a single click to instantly bypass massive chunks of logic during execution!
- ⚡ **Multi-Rule Sorting & Summarization**: Build incredibly complex group-by chains and sequential sorting rules seamlessly. Our native Polars backend engine rips through multi-column aggregations instantly!
- 🧠 **Semantic Type Profiling**: Loomflow's execution engine automatically profiles incoming data to detect logical semantic types (like `currency_usd`, `percentage`, `email`).
- 💎 **Semantic Propagation**: When a semantic type is detected, the Engine maps it directly through the computational DAG! This metadata drives intelligent UI rendering—displaying `$` badges in your preview grid, formatting Plotly axes dynamically into currency layouts, and guiding users seamlessly.
- ⭐ **Dynamic Tool Favorites**: Fully customize your workspace! Pin any tool to your exclusive "Favorites" group by clicking its Star badge, completely eliminating scrolling and searching when building workflows. Your preferences are instantly saved to your browser's local storage and flawlessly restored across sessions!
- 🔢 **True Sequential Numbering & Find**: Navigating massive workflows is incredibly easy with true, clean sequential Node IDs (`node_1`, `node_2`) that make hitting the "Find" bar extremely powerful and accurate.
- ✨ **Intelligent Canvas Branching**: Build complex, multi-path workflows effortlessly. The canvas dynamically preserves all existing edge connections when dropping new tools, allowing you to seamlessly branch a single output into multiple downstream tools simultaneously.
- 🧲 **Smart Canvas Mechanics**: Magnetic wire snapping, node-collision detection, cascading auto-drops, and a dedicated "Clear All Cache" tool keep the canvas incredibly responsive and visually flawless!

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

To make Loomflow user-friendly for tech-savvy users, we have provided automated startup scripts that instantly handle virtual environments, npm packages, and dual-server startup!

### Method 1: The Automated Runner (Recommended)

These scripts (`run.ps1` for Windows, `run.sh` for Mac/Linux) are the primary entrypoints for Loomflow. They automatically set up your Python virtual environment, install Node.js dependencies, and launch both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
.\run.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux (Bash)**
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Step-by-Step

If you prefer to run the components manually in separate terminals:

**Backend (Terminal 1)**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # (Or source venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

**Frontend (Terminal 2)**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧩 Developer Guide: Zero-Code UI Integration

To extend **Loomflow** with your own customized nodes, we have designed a **completely dynamic SDK architecture**! 

Developers do **NOT** need to write any React/Javascript to build forms! Simply build and register a single Python class in `backend/app/tools/`, define a `MANIFEST` dictionary, and the platform will automatically generate your Canvas nodes, Lucide icons, Category groups, Form inputs, and Default states dynamically at runtime!

*Check the codebase for examples of how our dynamic manifests automatically render complex UI components like multi-select dropdowns, data previews, and code-completion textareas!*
